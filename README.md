# Casting Defects
A casting defect is an undesired irregularity in a metal casting process. Usually, these products are scrutinized before assembling or packing them. Some defects can be tolerated while others can be repaired, otherwise they must be eliminated. Some of the common casting defects are:

* Blow Holes
* Hot tears
* Shrinkage Cavity
* Fins

#### Blow Holes
These are ballon shaped gas cavities caused by the release of mould gases during liquid metal pouring.

 #### Hot tears
 A hot tear is the defect that occurs during the solidification stage of a casting operation, when the material being cast is part solid and part liquid.  If some force prevents metal contraction then a hot tear will occur.

#### Fins
Fins, also known as casting flash or burrs, is any unwanted and excess material attached to a cast.

 #### Shrinkage Cavity
 Depression in surface or internal void caused by solidification shrinkage that restricts the amount of molten metal available in the last region to freeze
